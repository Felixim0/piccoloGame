# Piccaloe
Knockoff of the app picaloe, because it's just a very basic card game with slight intergrations iwth technology that can be easily replicated


# Running
Open a powershell window in the root directory
Run    `node . `


# Install as a PWA
In theory this game is runnable as a progressive web app and should be offered as an install through github pages (link here when I get around to it)
